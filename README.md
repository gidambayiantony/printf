printf collaborative project
This a repository for the ALX team project for the printf.

The printf() function prints output to stdout, according to format and other arguments passed to printf(). The string format consists of two types of items - characters that will be printed to the screen, and format commands that define how the other arguments to printf() are displayed. Simply put, we specify a format string that has text in it, as well as "special" characters that map to the other arguments of printf().

The prototype of this function is: int _printf(const char format, ...);

This means that it has one mandatory format argument, and an extra number of arguments that can be none, or many.
